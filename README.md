# UNO.py

My first OOP Python project.

> [Note:]\
> Despite the name, UNO.py isn't actually a single file, but it's nicer to call it that. :P

# How to run?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theSanguss/UNO.py.git
cd UNO.py
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

# How to operate?

This is a CLI-based application, so entering in inputs as you would on a console/terminal is pretty much all you need to do. Most inputs are self-explanatory, and those that aren't are specified and detailed in-game.

# Is this just another boring CLI?

Thankfully not. For this projects makes extensive use of the wonderful Rich library in Python, by @Textualise.
